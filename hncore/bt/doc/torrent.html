<h3>Bittorrent Module Design</h3>
</center>
<p style="border: 1px solid green; padding: 5px;"><img
 src="torrentfiles.png"></p>
<p>Manager is a Singleton class, which owns Torrent objects, and keeps
a map of them, keyed by info_hash value, which is unique to every
torrent. Manager class also
controls incoming connections listener, and accepts connections from
it. Upon accepting
an incoming connection, it constructs a Client object, and attaches the
newly connected
socket to the Client. The Client object will be owned by Manager class
for the time
being.</p>
<p>Once the newly-created Client object receives handshake, it emits
handshakeReceived
signal, which Manager will handle. Based on the info_hash value
received in the
handshake, Manager will attach the client to an existing Torrent, or
drop the client
if no torrent with the specified info_hash could be found. After
attaching the client
to an existing Torrent object, Manager also transfers ownership of the
object to the
Torrent object.</p>
<p>Notice that differently from other p2p networks, in Bittorrent it is
not needed
to keep disconnected Client objects alive, so there is no need for
"merging" system,
as implemented in eDonkey2000 plugin. All incoming clients trigger a
new Client object
being constructed, and once a Client loses it's underlying TCP
connection, it must
immediately be destroyed (most likely implementation would be a
connectionLost signal
being emitted), so whoever owns the object at the moment will destroy
it.</p>
<h4>Starting new torrent downloads</h4>
<p>In Bittorrent, a single download often consists of many files, which
form a bigger
package. On protocol level, there is no "file" concept at all, and all
data in the
torrent is handled as single long stream. The client is responsible for
keeping track
of which file what data range belongs to, and for the construction of
the final concrete
files.</p>
<p>In Hydranode, this means that a TorrentFile object is-a wrapper
around one-to-many
SharedFile objects, and directs IO calls to the specific SharedFile
object which corresponds to the right file. Likewise, PartialTorrent
object is-a wrapper around
PartData object, keeping a offset-keyed map of sub-objects of type
PartData, and forwards the required functions to the concrete PartData
objects.</p>
<p>Since TorrentFile and PartialTorrent objects are derived classes
from SharedFile and
PartData, respectivly, they cannot be constructed by FilesList on
applications startup.
Hence, they must be constructed by Bittorrent module during it's
startup. Most likely
implementation would be to keep a copy of the corresponding .torrent
file in configuration directory, and re-construct the
TorrentFile/PartialTorrent objects from
that.</p>
<h4>Hashing</h4>
<p>Since Bittorrent protocol has no concept of files, chunk hashes can
cross file
boundaries. Hydranode hashing engine, however, doesn't support it by
default, hence
the HashWork class must also be customized to support this kind of
behaviour. To this,
the needed virtual functions will be overridden, to allow data
verification across
multiple files.</p>
<h4>Protocol overview</h4>
<p>There are many proper Bittorrent protocol specifications available
on the internet,
most useful ones being the <a
 href="http://www.bittorrent.com/protocol.html">official
specification</a> and a wiki-based <a
 href="http://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification">unofficial
specfication</a>.
As such, the entire protocol specification is beyond the scope of this
document; instead,
we will only go briefly over the details here.</p>
<h5>Bencoding</h5>
<p>The metainfo file (.torrent file), as well as Tracker responses in
Client &lt;-&gt; Tracker
communication are bencoded. Four data types are specified (in <a
 href="http://www.boost.org/libs/spirit/index.html">Boost.Spirit</a>
grammar notification):</p>
<pre><b>Integers:</b>     'i' &gt;&gt; int_p &gt;&gt; 'e'<br><b>Strings:</b>      int_p[assign_a(tmp)] &gt;&gt; ':' &gt;&gt; repeat_p(boost::ref(tmp))[anychar_p]<br><b>Lists:</b>        'l' &gt;&gt; *(Integer | String | List | Dict) &gt;&gt; 'e'<br><b>Dictionaries:</b> 'd' &gt;&gt; *(String &gt;&gt; (Integer | String | List | Dict)) &gt;&gt; 'e'<br></pre>
<h5>Client &lt;-&gt; Tracker communication</h5>
<p>Client initializes the communication by establishing a TCP
connection with the tracker, at the specified IP / Port indicated in
the MetaInfo file. Upon a successful
connection, Client sends a HTTP request with the following structure:</p>
<pre>GET /%1%?info_hash=%2%&amp;peer_id=%3%&amp;port=%4%&amp;uploaded=%5%&amp;downloaded=%6%&amp;left=%7%&amp;event=%8%compact=%9% HTTP/1.1<br>Connection: close<br>Host: %10%:%11%<br><br></pre>
<p>The arguments to GET request are as follows:</p>
<pre><b>%1%</b>   Announce URL path, e.g. "/announce" for http://tracker.url/announce<br><b>%2%</b>   SHA1 hash of the info dictionary (bencoded form) of the MetaInfo file (urlencoded)<br><b>%3%</b>   ID of the Client (20 bytes) (may be url-encoded)<br><b>%4%</b>   Port where the Client has a TCP listener socket for incoming connections<br><b>%5%</b>   Amount of data the Client has already uploaded this torrent<br><b>%6%</b>   Amount of data the Client has already downloaded from this torrent<br><b>%7%</b>   How much data he Client still needs to complete the Torrent<br><b>%8%</b>   One of "started", "stopped" or "completed"<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">%9%</span>   Whether the client understands compact peer list (some modern trackers require this already)<br><b>%10%</b>  Host of the tracker<br><b>%11%</b>  Port of the tracker</pre>
<p>Notice that the info_hash key, as well as (possibly) the peer_id key
must be URL-encoded, e.g. all characters not in the set <i>0-9 a-z A-Z
$-_+!*'()</i> must be
replaced with % followed by hexadecimal notation of the character.</p>
<p><i>Implementors note: When the hexadecimal value of the character is
less than 16,
it must be preceeded with '0' character - many trackers expect
two-digit hexadecimal
numbers in all cases.</i><br>
<br>
Tracker responds with a standard HTTP response, where data part
contains a bencoded
dictionary with a set of the following keys: "failure reason", "warning
message",
"interval", "min interval", "tracker id", "complete", "incomplete",
"peers". The latter
is a list of dictionaries with the following keys: "peer id", "ip",
"port", or in case of compact list, a bencoded string with content
being 4+2-byte value pairs (binary). The first 4 bytes in each pair
represent the ip address of the client, the latter the port.<br>
</p>
<h5>Client &lt;-&gt; Client communication</h5>
<p>Client &lt;-&gt; Client communication is done over TCP connection;
messages can be sent
in both direction, and look identical in both ways. Packet header:</p>
<pre>+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------<br>|           packet length           |   id   |   payload<br>+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------<br></pre>
<p>All integer values in the protocol are 4 bytes, in big-endian
ordering. Payload is length -1 bytes long (e.g. packet id is also
considered when calculating
packet length). The following packets are currently being used in the
official
protocol:
</p>
<pre><b>keep-alive:</b>     length = 0, no ID / payload parts<br><b>choke:</b>          ID = 0, no payload<br><b>unchoke:</b>        ID = 1, no payload<br><b>interested:</b>     ID = 2, no payload<br><b>not interested:</b> ID = 3, no payload<br><b>have:</b>           ID = 4, &lt;index&gt;<br><b>bitfield:</b>       ID = 5, set of bits indicating which chunks the client has<br><b>request:</b>        ID = 6, &lt;index&gt;&lt;begin&gt;&lt;length&gt;<br><b>piece:</b>          ID = 7, &lt;index&gt;&lt;begin&gt;&lt;data&gt;<br><b>cancel:</b>         ID = 8, &lt;index&gt;&lt;begin&gt;&lt;length&gt;<br></pre>
