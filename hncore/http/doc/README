 * segmented downloading via 'addsource <num> <link>' command in hnsh
 * automatic aquiring of:
   * new download sources (and even FTP-links) via www.filemirrors.com
   * file hashes (e.g. fetching files like: .md5, .sha1, MD5SUM, SHA1SUM, ...)
   * .torrent files (for multi-network-downloads)

Config options:
 * SearchMirrors:
   * possible values: true/false
   * function: if set to true new file mirror will be searched automatically
 * SearchHashes:
   * possible values: true/false
   * function: if set to true file hashes will be searched
