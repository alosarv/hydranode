  * Fixed issues with UDP packets handling when multiple packets arrive with
    short interval (previously this caused the socket to become 'dead')
  * Support for more than 64 concurrent open connections on Windows

    actual results may vary depending on various conditions.

 eDonkey2000 Module (madcat)
  * Reduced outgoing client connection timeout from 30s to 5s
  * Fixed parsing QueueRanking packets from MLDonkey clients

    the remote client contacted us and sent AcceptUploadReq, and we didn't send 
    ReqFile.
  * Now properly destroys remote LowID clients if we are also LowID.
  * More default (hardcoded) servers
  * Support for global searching
  * Miscellaneous protocol performance improvements and fine-tuning
  * Properly switches sources to other files on download completition now

    source queries effectiveness by ~5 times (from 4% to 20+%)
  * Better A4AF handling
  * Listening ports are now restarted instantly after runtime configuration 
    changes
  * Setting 'ed2k/FindServers' can be set to '0' now to disable receiving

Changes since version 0.1.1:
----------------------------

Engine:
 * Custom MetaData fields support (for http urls, torrent data etc).
 * Fixed writing to temp files for which there are no known chunks
   (e.g. chunkless downloading).
 * Hashing is paused while scanning directories to improve scan
   performance with many files / folders.
 * Properly fixed UDP sockets polling.
 * Theoretical support for other big endian platforms, such as SPARC, Alpha and
   MIPS.
 * More generic binary IO API, which can handle all combinations of
   host/protocol endianess cleanly.
 * Support for ip filters. MlDonkey, eMule and guardian.p2p formats are
   supported and auto-detected.
 * Improved global random number generator.
 * Improved support for FAT32 partition as temp files location.
 * Safer and improved handling of the situation where temp/shared files
   are modified outside the application.
 * Ctrl+C now causes clean shutdown on Windows platform as well.
 * Fixed endless loops when shared files are deleted.
 * Handles hashing of files without read permission on UNIX gracefully.
 * Better deduction of configuration directory location on Windows, no longer
   adds redundant ".exe" extension.
 * Avoid 100% CPU load loop when there are no sockets being used.
 * Added support for changing configuration settings on runtime.
 * Running out of disk space no longer corrupts temp files.
 * Added asyncronous DNS resolution API

eDonkey2000 Module:
 * Avoid excessive TCP reasks when UDP reasks start failing.
 * Miscellanous bugfixes and stability improvements.
 * Userhashes are now more random.
 * Now properly supports min/max filesize and type queries at protocol level.
 * Can now import partial eMule/aMule format downloads.
 * Fixed Secure User Identification on big endian platforms.
 * Updated to Zlib 1.2.3 - fixes multiple potential security vulnerabilities
   and miscellaneus bugs.
 * Fixed problems of downloading files less than 9500kb.
 * No longer overwrites port settings when fallback ports are being used.
 * Improved server connection randomization.
 * Fixed some bugs that caused connection attempts to multiple servers at same
   time.
 * Fine-tuned server connecting login and timeout handling.

Hydranode Shell Module:
 * New global commands:
   - ifs:     Displays ipfilter statistics.
   - vr:      Displays most recent search results; allows sorting by various
              predicates.
   - vd:      Now also allows sorting of the list.
   - import:  Attempt to import downloads from specified location (e.g. eMule
              partial downloads).
   - config:  Allows changing configuration settings on runtime
              (only speeds/connections have effect right now).
   - log:     Enables/disables log messages printing to shell.
 * New context-specific new commands:
   - at modules/ed2k/serverlist: stat - displays current server and network
                                        status.

New modules:
 * Http   - allows downloading of files view HTTP/1.1 protocol.

New/Updated utilities:
 * hlink     - sends various types of links (ed2k, http et al) to running
               Hydranode for downloading.
 * hnanalyze - several performance upgrades, now also supports monthly and
               yearly graphs.
 * hydraload - plugin for FireFox browser that adds "Download with Hydranode..."
               to right-click context menu.


================================================================================

v0.1.1 - Bugfixes and win32 port improvements
25/05/2005
	Highlights:
	  * Largely improved performance on Windows
	  * Many important bug/crash fixes

	eDonkey2000 Module:
	  * Fixed several crashes in eDonkey2000 module
	  * Source-counters at various places are now more in sync
	  * Fixed eDonkey2000 module internally duplicating each download object
	  * Lowered default connection-limit to 50 on win32 until a better
	    workaround against WinXP-connection-limits is implemented
	Engine:
	  * Fixed temp files loading from backup
	  * Settings files are now created on first startup,
	    rather than on first save/shutdown
	  * Low-level IO functions now use 32bit length values
	    (this caused very broken downloading performance on win32)
	  * Fixed UDP sockets re-usage on Win2K/WinXP
	    (fixes UDP reasks on Win32) [credits: anonymous blog comment]
	Hydranode Shell:
	  * HNShell no longer over-writes configuration values when fallback
	    ports are being used
	  * Added "add" command to modules/ed2k/serverlist (for adding servers)
	Compilation/Build system:
	  * Fixed compilation with custom boost path
	    (use --with-boost=[abs-path] now)
	  * Build system detects additional cases where system-wide
	    Boost dlls are broken (SuSE 9.3 for example)
	  * Fixed Boost libraries version checking on Darwin
	Platform-specific:
	  * Fixed modules loading when starting Hydranode from Finder (Darwin)

================================================================================

v0.1.0 - First public release
15/05/2005
	* Full support for eDonkey2000 network
	* Built-in shell functionality
	* Background daemon mode


================================================================================

* Dec 7, 2004 Alo Sarv <madcat@hydranode.com>
	HydraNode now uses GNU build system. Users familiar with it should feel
	right at home. Just in case someone forgot:
	When building from CVS snapshot, you need to run autogen.sh first to
	generate the basic files. autogen.sh requires various GNU auto-tools.

	Run `configure', followed by `make'. Useful configure arguments are
	--enable-optimize (disabled by default), and --enable-colors (enabled
	by default). The binaries are built in their respective subdirectories,
	but symlinked also to top-level directory for easier access.

================================================================================

* May 15, 2004 Alo Sarv <madcat@hydranode.com>
	Initial launch of HydraNode project.
